# Dissertation project

</br>This was a project to test if it was possible to bypass anti cheat methods via a hardware based solution.
</br>To replicate this you will need an Arduino Uno and to refer to the fritzing diagram for the hardware setup.

</br>The Arduino IDE is required in order to upload the code
</br>To run the backend the processing IDE is required.

</br>This was developed (originally) to test against the following games:

</br>Halo: The Master Chief Collection - (Halo: Reach)
</br>Counter Strike: Global Offensive
</br>RuneScape - unable to of been implemented.

</br>Note that not all functions work.

</br>In order to use this by default it will load with the Halo: Reach config.
</br>To cycle through the configs press the fifth button
</br>To cancel an action press the fourth button (pressing the fifth button can also do this but it will change the config)
</br>There is a total of three configs (more can be added). However the third one is blank.

</br>Halo: Reach buttons:

</br>button 1 - jumpcrouch (the action of rapidly jumping and crouching at the same time to disort the hitbox)
</br>button 2 - strafe (it will automatically strafe for you using random timings)
</br>button 3 - melee shot (it will perform the melee action then shoot after the melee, this doesn't work as intended)

</br>Counter Strike: Global Offensive:
</br>button 1 - tapshoot (it will fire your weapon with controlled bursts with random timings)
</br>button 2 - bunnyhop (it will bunnyhop for you - does not work as intended)
